    <h1>About Rubber Duck</h1>
    <p>
      This app is here to help you find and solve your problems. Based on the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"
        >Rubber duck debuging method</a
      >, it is mostly focused on software engineers. However, everyone is
      welcome to use the duck.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Simply start by explaining your problem to the duck as specifically as
      possible - remember that the duck does not know anything about your
      problem before you start talking to it. The idea is that by being forced
      to put your ideas into words, you are forced to confront the parts of the
      problems you thought you understood but did not. Usually, this is enough
      to figure where the issue was and how to fix it.
