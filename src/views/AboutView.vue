    <h1>About Rubber Duck</h1>
    <p>
      This app is here to help you find and solve your problems. Based on the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"
        >rubber duck debugging method</a
      >, it is mostly focused on helping software engineers to get rid of the
      bugs in their code. However, everyone is welcome to consult the duck with
      any sort of problem.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Begin by explaining your problem to the duck. Remember to be as specific
      as possible; the duck does not know anything about your problem, you must
      introduce it to the topic.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We often think we understand a problem and fail to realise that we have
      missed possible solutions. By having to explain the problem to someone who
      knows nothing about it, one is forced to confront all parts and
      perspectives of it, which is often enough to find the solution.
