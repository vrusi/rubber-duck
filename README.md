# Rubber Duck

This app is here to help you find and solve your problems. Based on the rubber duck debugging method, it is mostly focused on helping software engineers to get rid of the bugs in their code. However, everyone is welcome to consult the duck with any sort of problem.

Begin by explaining your problem to the duck. Remember to be as specific as possible; the duck does not know anything about your problem, you must introduce it to the topic.

We often think we understand a problem and fail to realise that we have missed possible solutions. By having to explain the problem to someone who knows nothing about it, one is forced to confront all parts and perspectives of it, which is often enough to find the solution.
